# Crop-Yeild-Prediction-AI-model
In this project made an AI model to predict the Yeild of 5 major crops of India.
Created an AI model using the RandomForest algorithm to predict the crop yeild of the 5 major crops of India for each state using the factors,
such as Temprature, Rainfall and Pesticides used in those states with the help of previous historic data.

Future Scope : 
Including more crops and targeting different regions of India.
Using realtime weather data for Predictions.
Including more feature for the prediction and increase accuracy of the model.
